  <p style="color: black;"> David Robert Joseph Beckham OBE (born 2 May 1975) is an English former professional footballer, the current president and co-owner of Inter Miami and co-owner of Salford City.
    Known for his range of passing, crossing ability, and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Beckham has been hailed as one of the greatest and most recognisable midfielders of his generation, as well as one of the best set-piece specialists of all time.
    He is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France.
    Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17.
    With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.
    He then played four seasons with Real Madrid, winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club. 
    In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy. While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with AC Milan in 2009 and 2010.
    He was the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games. He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies.

  <h2>Early life</h2>
  <p>
    David Robert Joseph Beckham was born on 2 May 1975 at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England.
    He is the son of Sandra Georgina (n√©e West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan "Ted" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, 1948), a kitchen fitter;
    the couple married in 1969 in the London Borough of Hackney. He was given the middle name Robert in honour of Bobby Charlton, his father's favourite footballer.
    He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He attended Chingford County High School in Nevin Drive, Chingford.
    In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, "At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' 
    But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do."
    Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and Beckham has referred to himself as "half Jewish" and wrote in his autobiography "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion".
    In his book Both Feet on the Ground, Beckham stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.

  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>
    1991-1994: Youth and early-career
    Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991, Beckham was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes,
    who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3-1 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992.
    In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3-2 in favour of Manchester United and 6-3 on aggregate.
    Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion.
    Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.
    Manchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they faced Leeds United. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2-0 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage.
    In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2-1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4-1 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994.
    In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4-0 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage.
    Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.</p>
